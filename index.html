        <p>Founded in 2007, UBC Kababayan, or KABA is a recognized socio-cultural student organization of UBC at its Vancouver campus.
          KABA acknowledges that it is located on the traditional, ancestral and unceded territory of the Musqueam people - a land that has always been a place of learning.
          We aim to preserve and promote Filipino culture through various school events, community engagement initiatives, and our social media platforms. 
          We instill in all of our members the Filipino value of kapwa, the ability to see ourselves in the other, no matter who they are. 
          KABA is affiliated with the Filipino Canadian Students' Association (FILCASA) and the UBC Association of Southeast Asian Clubs (ASEAC). 
          These collaborations allow us to continuously engage with the UBC community and the larger Filipino-Canadian community, which aids us in our mission of cultivating a deeper appreciation for Filipino culture.
        </p>

        <p>
          To foster an inclusive community for UBC students of all nationalities, and to explore and learn about the rich culture, heritage, and tradition of the Philippines
